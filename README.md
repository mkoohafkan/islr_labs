This repository contains worked-through labs accompanying each chapter of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R*.  

A PDF version of the book is avaiable [online](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf), and is also found in `00_text`.  

Each folder contains 3 items:  

1. a folder of the figures geenrated in the lab  
2. a `.Rmd` (RMarkdown) script with the code for the lab  
3. a `README.md` file which displays the code and figures for the lab directly on github
